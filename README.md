1) Rock Vs Mine Prediction :

Abstract:
Predicting the nature of submerged objects, specifically distinguishing between rocks and mines, holds great significance in marine activities such as navigation and defense operations. This study presents the development of a predictive model using machine learning techniques to differentiate between rocks and mines based on sonar data. The model's accuracy and efficiency were evaluated through rigorous testing, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for real-world applications.

Model Applied : Logistic Regression
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether newly collected sonar signals correspond to mines or rocks. The model calculates the probability of an object being a mine, and a threshold can be set to classify the object as either a mine or a rock based on this probability. By using logistic regression in this scenario, it becomes possible to make accurate predictions about the nature of objects detected underwater, helping to ensure the safety of naval operations and marine environments.

Conclusion:
This study showcases the successful development of a predictive model capable of distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar data. The model's high accuracy and balanced performance metrics demonstrate its potential to enhance underwater object detection and classification. Further research could explore real-time deployment and adaptability to different underwater environments, contributing to improved marine safety and security.
