1) Rock Vs Mine Prediction :

Abstract:
Predicting the nature of submerged objects, specifically distinguishing between rocks and mines, holds great significance in marine activities such as navigation and defense operations. This study presents the development of a predictive model using machine learning techniques to differentiate between rocks and mines based on sonar data. The model's accuracy and efficiency were evaluated through rigorous testing, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for real-world applications.

Conclusion:
This study showcases the successful development of a predictive model capable of distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar data. The model's high accuracy and balanced performance metrics demonstrate its potential to enhance underwater object detection and classification. Further research could explore real-time deployment and adaptability to different underwater environments, contributing to improved marine safety and security.
